    <h1>Cheesecake</h1>
    <img width="30%" src="../images/cheesecake.jpg">
    <p>Don't run away! This one isn't so bad. This cheesecake is lactose free. No, it's not vegan - I doubt there's a way to make vegan cheesecake, but at least you won't fall sick from the lactose.</p>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 block of lactose free cheese</li>
        <li>1.5 cups of crushed graham cracker</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla essence</li>
        <li>0.5 cup sugar </li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>3 tbsp melted butter</li>
        <li>Raspberry jam</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Leave eggs and cheese on the counter to come to room temperature</li>
        <li>Crush the graham cracker if you haven't already done so. Then mix in the melted butter.</li>
        <li>In a springform pan lined with parchment paper, pour the graham cracker and press down to form a solid base</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 F for 10 minutes. Then remove from oven and let cool. Leave the oven on and reduce heat to 325 F</li>
        <li>While the base is cooling, prepare the cheese filling. In a mixing bowl, start mixing the cheese on low speed.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, then add the sugar and vanilla and mix on medium high until smooth</li>
        <li>Pour the cheese filling into  the spring form pan and gently tap it down on the counter so it spreads evenly</li>
        <li>Bake for 40 minutes on the middle rack.</li>
        <li>Once baking is complete, turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake in the oven to cool slowly, leaving the oven door open a crack.</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes, open the oven door wider and let the cake continue to cool for another 30 minutes. This will keep it from cracking. </li>
        <li>Remove the cake from the oven and let sit on the counter until slightly warm, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill.</li>
        <li>Once chilled, top with raspberry jam and serve!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The End!</h3>
